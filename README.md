###1.Closet Point Pair
###2.Convex Hull
###3.Cut-Vertex
###4.is Bipartiteness
###5.Red Black Tree
A program to mantain a tree that meet the RBT's conditions.
###6.Dynamic Hash Table
A Hash Table using pointer to a Bucket pointer array.When insertion happend and table need split,double expand table but new extension only have points to old part.It avoid high cost on contributiing a hash table. This new insertion will be inserted in new extension and the corresponding bucket's data will be taken out and reinsert again.  
###7.Optimal Binary Search Tree

###8.Longest Common Subsequents
